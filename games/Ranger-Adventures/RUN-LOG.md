# Ranger van de Veluwe — Run Log (append-only)

One status block per run/step (BUILD-PLAN §9b).

**2026-07-03 12:31:35Z** · ticked: - [x] P0.1 · Archive the Run A evidence BEFORE any new capture. `audit-evidence/{laptop,ipad,crops}/*.png` + `annotations-*.json` are git-IGNORED and the first `npm run capture` overwrites them (§3 substrate rule; §9 A6). Copy the whole current `audit-evidence/` to `audit-evidence-baseline-run-a/` and git-add the annotations + a README so the frames F-01..F-34 cite survive. Verify by: the baseline folder holds the Run A PNGs + both annotations; nothing captured yet.

▶ phase:  Phase 0 · protect + see  (NO game code — `app/e2e-capture/**` + copies only)
→ next:   P0.2 · F-21 · harden the capture harness [both]. In `app/e2e-capture/` only: scene-isolated pages/contexts (re-seed the sessionStorage gate + ranger game state per scene group so one renderer death can't erase later scenes); drive the iPad board/jeep/steer approach with touch (tap-to-walk / joystick), keeping keyboard for the `laptop` project only; one crash-retry per scene. Verify by: shot — a capture run completes with board + mission + reduce-motion PNGs present on BOTH projects, iPad locomotion touch-driven (not `page.keyboard`).

▷ progress: ~3%
⚠ blocker: W7.5 NEEDS-FLORIS: iPad-acceptatie op het echte apparaat (alvah.nl/ranger achter de gate, nu live op ship-bundle 2.1.0-ship). Check hands-on: (1) lopen met de joystick EN tap-to-walk, (2) jeep in/uit + rijden, (3) één missie vanaf een wereld-marker spelen, (4) Deep Demo (?demo) doorlopen, (5) Verminder-beweging in BEIDE standen (aan: kalm/cuts, uit: volledig). Dit is de laatste open box; alle W0-W7.4 zijn groen en gedeployed. Kan niet autonoom — vereist jouw iPad.

→ next:   P0.2 · DEFERRED (iPad) · F-21 · harden the capture harness. Parked while Run B is laptop-only (the iPad software-render hang is exactly F-21's own suspected cause). The scene-isolation + crash-retry parts already landed in `app/e2e-capture/capture.spec.ts` and help the laptop run too; the iPad touch-driving + a real fix for the render hang wait until `CAPTURE_PROJECTS=laptop,ipad` is re-enabled. Until then iPad is verified in the Floris demo. Loop skips this box.
